## Background of Project

As of writing this post, I have studied Russian for approximately 9 years. I enjoyed studying Russian enough that I also studied it in college in addition to statistics. Since I enjoy both the Russian language and statistics, I wanted to find a way to combine the two of them together. Natural language processing (NLP) is one way that I am able to combine the two interests where computers and algorithms are used to analyze and attempt to find meaning from human language.

In a linguistics class I took in college, we were briefly introduced to topic modeling. Topic modeling is a form of unsupervised machine learning that takes a large collection of documents and attempts to find relevant topics or clusters. In this class, we were only introduced to the general idea of it, but since I have a statistics background, I spent some time learning about topic modeling. I won't outline much of the statistical details here because there are more than enough resources on the internet already that outline the statistics behind topic modeling. 

Since I found the idea and details behind topic modeling interesting, I decided to make that the center of this project. When deciding what kind of text I wanted to analyze, I decided to examine texts from two unique areas: literature and music. I really enjoy Dostoevsky's works of literature with Crime and Punishment being one of my favorite novels of all-time, so I wanted to analyze his works. When deciding what type of music to examine, I eventually decided to collect the lyrics for songs written by Viktor Tsoi, who was one of the more influential musicians in the Soviet Union and his music is still popular among people in Russia. 

The final idea for this project was inspired by [this post](https://medium.com/the-die-is-forecast/topic-modeling-as-osint-exploring-russian-presidential-speech-topics-over-time-ad6018286d37), which outlined looking at topics discovered from topic modeling over time and examining which themes were more prevalent over the course of time. I thought this would be interesting to explore, especially because Dostoevsky's writing evolved and changed over time and I was interested if I could discover topics or groups that could show that. 

The rest of this post will outline where the data was collected from, how the text was preprocessed for topic modeling, the process of determining the topics, and finally examining the prevalence of these topics over time.
